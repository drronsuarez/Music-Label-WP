== Description ==

Music Label WP works with another plugin called "magpierss" (which adds support for RSS enclosures) to deliver artist and album music content rss feeds from Loud Feed into Wordpress. Soon the Loud Feed code base will be released as GPL Open Source.

Loud Feed offers free accounts for artists, labels and their representatives to manage all of their digital assets including cover art, liner notes, artist bios, etc. See: http://loudfeed.com

== Installation ==

First, install the magpierss plugin from:
http://lud.icro.us/wordpress-plugin-magpierss-hotfix/

Then, install the "Music Label WP" plugin from:
http://musiclabelwp.loudfeed.com/download/

Unzip the ZIP file and drop the folder straight into your `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

== Known Problems ==

* Workaround for known issue we’re fixing ASAP *
To get the top level artist page or album page to work Activate, Decactivate and Activate the plugin again through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

== Roadmap ==

Soon we'll be adding a feed for tour data about shows and ticketing.

In addition we're working on the integration of capabilities using the JQuery UI, especially for labels with many artists and albums who need a better way to browse through their catalogs plus filtering by genre.
